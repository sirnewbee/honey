            <p class="lead">Francing’s EcoProducts is named after the deceased wife of the resident apiculturist (“bee expert”), Evert Jan Robberts, of Sinacaban EcoFarm where Francing’s EcoProducts are produced and packaged. The “Honest” in Honest Honey is to emphasize that the product is pure and has been verified using, among others, the refractory method, to measure its moisture content and thus, its purity.</p>
